# Zepto Support Assistant

Module 3 of the IIT Patna AI/ML Capstone.

This module implements a retrieval-augmented Zepto policy support assistant using the eight provided policy documents, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings, ChromaDB retrieval, LangGraph orchestration, structured Pydantic responses, and a FastAPI `/ask` endpoint.

The graded baseline uses deterministic `MOCK_LLM` behavior and does not require an API key or external LLM for inference.

`chroma_db/` is generated locally by the ingestion step and is intentionally not committed to GitHub because it can be recreated from the provided corpus with `ingest.py`.

## Module Requirements Covered

This implementation covers the Module 3 requirements:

1. Eight Zepto policy documents loaded into the support-assistant corpus.
2. Document chunking using one chunk per document.
3. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence-transformer embeddings.
4. ChromaDB vector storage using cosine similarity.
5. Structured prompt with Role, Context, Task, Format, and Length sections.
6. Explicit negative constraint and few-shot example.
7. LangGraph `StateGraph` orchestration with `TypedDict` state.
8. Three graph nodes:
   - `classify_intent`
   - `retrieve_and_answer`
   - `direct_answer`
9. Conditional routing between policy and general questions.
10. Top-3 ChromaDB retrieval for policy questions.
11. Pydantic structured response containing `answer`, `sources`, and `confidence`.
12. FastAPI `POST /ask` endpoint with request and response validation.
13. Deterministic offline `MOCK_LLM` baseline.
14. Optional real-LLM path with structured JSON validation and retry handling.
15. Local Docker build and run.

## Knowledge Base / RAG Corpus

The `docs/` directory contains the eight policy documents supplied for the capstone:

```text
Doc 01 - Delivery
Doc 02 - Returns & Refunds
Doc 03 - Membership Tiers
Doc 04 - Order Tracking
Doc 05 - Order Cancellation
Doc 06 - Damaged/Missing
Doc 07 - Gift Cards
Doc 08 - Customer Support Hours
```

These documents form the knowledge base used by the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.

## File Responsibilities

### `ingest.py`

Loads all eight policy documents from `docs/`, creates one chunk per document, generates embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, normalizes the embeddings, and stores the documents, embeddings, IDs, and metadata in the ChromaDB collection `zepto_policies`.

The ChromaDB collection is configured for cosine similarity so the query retrieves the top three most relevant policy chunks.

### `prompt.py`

Contains the structured support-assistant prompt with:

- Role
- Context
- Task
- Format
- Length
- Negative constraint
- Few-shot example

The prompt instructs the answer-generation component to use only the supplied policy context and not invent policy details.

### `graph.py`

Contains the LangGraph workflow and the three required nodes:

- `classify_intent`
- `retrieve_and_answer`
- `direct_answer`

`classify_intent` uses the required deterministic keyword heuristic in the default mock mode.

`retrieve_and_answer` embeds the query, retrieves the top three policy chunks from ChromaDB, and produces the answer from the retrieved context.

`direct_answer` provides the required fixed mock response for non-policy questions without retrieval.

The graph uses a conditional edge after intent classification.

### `models.py`

Defines the Pydantic response schema:

```text
answer: str
sources: list[str]
confidence: float
```

The confidence value is constrained to the range `0.0` to `1.0`.

### `main.py`

Creates the FastAPI application and exposes:

```text
POST /ask
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "query": "string"
}
```

The response is validated using the `AnswerResponse` Pydantic model.

### `Dockerfile`

Builds the local application container, copies the policy corpus and application code, installs the required dependencies, runs `ingest.py` to build the ChromaDB index, and starts Uvicorn on port `7860`.

---

## Retrieval and Routing

The default graded behavior uses `MOCK_LLM=1` or an unset `MOCK_LLM`.

Intent classification uses the deterministic keyword heuristic required by the capstone.

The policy keywords are:

```text
delivery
return
refund
membership
tracking
cancel
gift card
support hours
```

Policy questions are routed to `retrieve_and_answer`.

General questions are routed to `direct_answer`.

For policy questions, retrieval always runs in both mock and optional real-LLM modes. The query is embedded and the top three chunks are retrieved from ChromaDB using cosine similarity.

---

## Structured Prompt

The prompt in `prompt.py` is organized into the required sections:

```text
ROLE
CONTEXT
TASK
FORMAT
LENGTH
NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT
FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE
CUSTOMER QUESTION
```

The negative constraint explicitly prevents invented policy details, and the few-shot example demonstrates the expected answer style.

---

## MOCK_LLM Behavior

The graded baseline is fully deterministic and offline.

When:

```text
MOCK_LLM=1
```

or the variable is not set:

- intent classification uses the deterministic keyword heuristic
- policy retrieval uses ChromaDB
- the answer uses the retrieved top chunk
- general questions use a fixed canned response
- no external LLM API call is required

The policy retrieval mock response follows the format:

```text
Based on the retrieved context: {top_chunk_snippet}
```

The general-question mock response is:

```text
I can only answer questions about Zepto policies right now.
```

The mock confidence value is:

```text
1.0
```

---

## Optional Real-LLM Path

The application also contains an optional real-LLM path.

Set:

```text
MOCK_LLM=0
```

and provide:

```text
GROQ_API_KEY
```

The real path uses the Groq client and the model configured in `graph.py`.

Structured JSON is validated against the Pydantic response schema. If the real path returns invalid JSON or violates the response schema, the implementation retries up to two additional times before returning a clear error response.

The graded capstone baseline does not depend on this optional path.

---

## Running Locally

From the `support_assistant` directory:

### 1. Build the local ChromaDB index

```powershell
python ingest.py
```

Expected verification includes:

```text
Documents loaded: 8
Chunks stored: 8
Collection: zepto_policies
ChromaDB collection count: 8
Task 1 verification: PASSED
```

### 2. Start the API

```powershell
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API is available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## API Usage

Endpoint:

```text
POST /ask
```

### Example 1: Policy Retrieval Query

Request:

```json
{
  "query": "What is the delivery fee for an order below INR 149?"
}
```

Raw response from the local FastAPI test:

```json
{"answer":"Based on the retrieved context: Zepto delivers grocery and household essentials to serviceable pin codes within 10 to 30 minutes of order confirmation, depending on the customer\u0027s delivery zone and current order volume. Standard del","sources":["doc_01","doc_05","doc_07"],"confidence":1.0}
```

This query is classified as a policy question, performs ChromaDB retrieval, and returns retrieved document IDs in `sources`.

### Example 2: General Query

Request:

```json
{
  "query": "What is the capital of India?"
}
```

Raw response from the local FastAPI test:

```json
{"answer":"I can only answer questions about Zepto policies right now.","sources":[],"confidence":1.0}
```

This query is classified as a general question and does not perform policy retrieval.

---

## Docker

Build the image from the `support_assistant` directory:

```powershell
docker build -t zepto-support-assistant .
```

Run the container:

```powershell
docker run --name zepto-support-assistant-container -p 7860:7860 zepto-support-assistant
```

The container starts Uvicorn on:

```text
http://localhost:7860
```

The FastAPI endpoint remains:

```text
POST /ask
```

The Docker build runs the ingestion step inside the image, so the ChromaDB index is recreated from the eight policy documents during the build.

---

## Verification Summary

The implemented and locally tested baseline verified:

```text
Task 1
  -> 8 documents loaded
  -> 8 chunks stored
  -> ChromaDB collection count = 8
  -> PASSED

Policy query
  -> policy_question
  -> ChromaDB retrieval
  -> top-3 sources returned
  -> confidence = 1.0

General query
  -> general_question
  -> no retrieval
  -> sources = []
  -> confidence = 1.0

FastAPI
  -> POST /ask tested for both policy and general queries

Docker
  -> image built successfully
  -> container served the FastAPI application on port 7860
```

---
